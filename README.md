# WebGlitz - Low Level web-graphics framework for Rust

WebGlitz is a "Rusty" abstraction that aims to make it safer and more pleasant to use WebGL 2.0, without adding
much additional runtime overhead to the core render-loop. The API is heavily inspired by modern graphics API's 
like Vulkan and Metal.

*WIP*: this library is still highly experimental and I expect there will still be many breaking changes. However, 
the general "shape" of the API should now be somewhat stable. If you're at all interested in an API like this, 
please do play around with it and share your thoughts (through Github issues)!

## Documentation

...is in a very sorry state at the moment. For now, the best way to get started is by having a look at the 
examples in the `/examples` folder.
