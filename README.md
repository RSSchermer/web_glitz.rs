# WebGlitz - Low Level Web-Graphics Framework for Rust

WebGlitz is a "Rusty" abstraction on top of WebGL 2.0 that aims to make it safer and easier to interface with the GPU 
without much additional runtime overhead in the core render-loop. The API is inspired by modern graphics API's like 
Vulkan, Metal and the upcoming WebGPU/GPUWeb API.

Requires nightly Rust.

*WIP*: this API is still likely to change here and there, but the general shape of the API should now be stable. If 
you're at all interested in an API like this, please play around with it and share your thoughts and ideas (preferably 
through [Github issues](https://github.com/RSSchermer/web_glitz.rs/issues))!

## Documentation

The examples in the [examples folder](./examples) demonstrate WebGlitz's core functionality and are a good way to get 
started. For details, refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/web-glitz).
