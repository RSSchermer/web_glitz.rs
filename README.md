# WebGlitz - Low Level web-graphics framework for Rust

WebGlitz is a "Rusty" abstraction on top of WebGL 2.0 that aims to make it safer and more easier to interface with the
GPU without much additional runtime overhead in the core render-loop. The API is heavily inspired by modern graphics 
API's like Vulkan, Metal and the upcoming WebGPU/GPUWeb API.

*WIP*: this library is still highly experimental and I expect there will still be many breaking changes. However, 
the general "shape" of the API should now be somewhat stable. If you're at all interested in an API like this, 
please do play around with it and share your thoughts (through Github issues)!

## Documentation

...is a work in progress. For now, the best way to get started is by having a look at the examples in the 
`/examples` folder.
