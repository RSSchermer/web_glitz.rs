# Transform Feedback Example

This example builds on the `/examples/1_uniform_block` example by recording the output
of the transform stage into a buffer, downloading its contents and logging it to the
console.

You can build the example locally with:

```
$ npm run serve
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 in a browser to see the result.
