# Render-To-Texture Example

This example builds on the `/examples/2_textured_triangle` example by first rendering a texture
image using a custom render target, rather than using a pre-existing image.

You can build the example locally with:

```
$ npm run serve
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 in a browser to see the result.
