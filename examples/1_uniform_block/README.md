# Uniform Block Example

This example builds on the `/examples/0_triangle` example by adding a uniform block with a uniform
variable that we'll use to scale the triangle to half its original size.

You can build the example locally with:

```
$ npm run serve
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 in a browser to see the result.
